  "readme_content": "\nThis dataset consists of electroencephalography (EEG) signals acquired with a 124 EEG ANT-Neuro device. \n\n### Participants and Sessions\nThere are 13 participants included, ten performed one session and three performed two sessions. All participants had normal or corrected vision and hearing, apart from sub-16.\n\n### Task\nThe task consisted of imagining and perceiving stimuli from three modalities; visual pictorial, visual orthographic (writing) or auditory. Each of the stimuli belonged to one of three categories: guitar, flower and penguin. These categories were selected based on being semantically dissimilar to one another, and because there were all of 2 syllables. \n\n### Dataset Versions\nThe dataset provided consists of the raw EEG data, a pre-processed version, and an epoched version. \n\n",
