(2024). CARLA: Adjusted common average referencing for cortico-cortical evoked potential data. Journal of Neuroscience Methods, 110153. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2024.110153.\n\nCurrently, this dataset contains the raw data needed to generate all results EXCEPT for those pertaining to figures 7 and 8 (unavailable data samples are censored with 0). The complete data are currently being used to answer other scientific questions, and will be released in time with other manuscripts.\n\nPlease cite this work when using the data. These data were recorded at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, as part of the NIH Brain Initiative supported project R01 MH122258 \"CRCNS: Processing speed in the human connectome across the lifespan\".
