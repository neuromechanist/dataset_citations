  "readme_content": "This experiment includes 146 subjects: 98 individuals with Parkinsons disease, \nand 48 controls. The data were collected from 2017-2021. Subjects completed this oddball task (along with multiple other cognitive tasks) \nwhile EEG was recorded with a 64-channel BrainVision cap. This task includes a primary GO cue,\n(white arrow) that required a directional response. That response could be correct or incorrect. The primary cue \n\nwas preceeded by a visual pre-cue and an auditory pre-cue, which occurred at the same time (500ms before arrow cue). \nEach trial had either standard for both pre-cues, oddball visual pre-cue, or oddball auditory pre-cue. \nOur analysis focused only on trials with both pre-cues standard or oddball auditory pre-cue.",
