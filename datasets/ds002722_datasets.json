DATASET\r\n------------\r\n\r\nEEG data from an affective Music Brain-Computer Interface: system calibration.\r\n\r\nDescription: This dataset accompanies the publication by Daly et al. (2018) and has been analysed in Daly et al. (2015) (please see Section 5 for full references). The purpose of the research activity in which the data were collected was to calibrate an affective brain-computer interface system to induce specific affective states by real-time online modification of synthetic music. \r\n\r\nFor this purpose, 20 healthy adult volunteers listened to music clips (40 s) targeting two affective states, as defined by valence and arousal (the first 20-s targeted state 1, while the remaining 20-s targeted state 2). Data were recorded over 1 session with 5 runs of 18 music trials each. The music clips were generated using a synthetic music generator.\r\n\r\nThe dataset contains the electroencephalogram (EEG), galvanic skin response (GSR) and electrocardiogram (ECG) data from 19 healthy adult participants while listening to the music clips, together with the reported affective state (valence and arousal values) and auxiliary variables. \r\n\r\nThis dataset is connected to 2 additional datasets: \r\n\r\n1.\tEEG data from an affective Music Brain-Computer Interface: offline training to induce target emotional states. doi:\r\n2.\tEEG data from an affective Music Brain-Computer Interface: online real-time control. doi:\r\nPlease note that the number of participants varies between datasets; however, participant codes are the same across all three datasets.\r\n\r\nPublication Year: 2018\r\n\r\nCreators: Nicoletta Nicolaou, Ian Daly\r\n\r\nContributors: Isil Poyraz Bilgin, James Weaver, Asad Malik, Alexis Kirke, Duncan Williams.\r\n\r\nPrincipal Investigator: Slawomir Nasuto(EP/J003077/1).\r\n\r\nCo-Investigator: Eduardo Miranda (EP/J002135/1).\r\n\r\nOrganisation: University of Reading\r\n\r\nRights-holders: University of Reading\r\n\r\nSource: The synthetic generator used to generate the music clips was presented in Williams et al., â€œAffective Calibration of Musical Feature Sets in an Emotionally Intelligent Music Composition Systemâ€, ACM Trans.

CONTENTS\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThe dataset comprises of data from 19 subjects. The sampling rate is 1 kHz and the music listening task corresponding to a music clip is 40 s long (clip duration). The 40-s music clip is generated in real-time by the music generator, based on the target emotional state (defined by LOW/NEUTRAL/HIGH valence and LOW/NEUTRAL/HIGH arousal).\r\n\r\n5.
