  "readme_content": "Resting EEG and MEG data was gathered for two independently collected samples of healthy and First Episode Psychosis (FEP) individuals.\r\nTo obtain resting data, EEG channels were recorded for 5 minutes using an Elekta Neuromag Vectorview system.\r\nEEG was recorded using a low-impedance 10-10 system 60-channel cap. \r\nThe first collected sample of EEG data is provided here. This sample includes a portion of subjects from the second acquisition (EEG: First Episode Psychosis vs. Control Resting Task 2), since they were collected using the same montage.\r\nThe subjects from Task 2 that have been included here are: sub-2140A, sub-2170A, sub-2174A, sub-2176A, sub-2177A, sub-2184A, sub-2193A, sub-2214A, sub-2217A, sub-2221A.\r\n\r\nThe phenotype directory contains clinical assessment results and data divided by type for all subjects. The assessment results were categorized as follows:\r\nBPRS - Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale,\r\nSANS - Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms,\r\nSAPS - Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms,\r\nGAFGAS - Global Assessment of Functioning,\r\nSFS - Social Functioning Scale,\r\nMATRICS - MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery,\r\nWASI - Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, \r\nHollingshead - Hollingshead Four-Factor Index of Socioeconomic Status,\r\nMedications - Chlorpromazine equivalency of prescribed medication at time of EEG scan.\r\nValues/scores that were not collected and questions without given responses are denoted by n/a.",
