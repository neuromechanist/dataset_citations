Mind wandering probes were inserted between trials.       **DATA NEVER PUBLISHED!**       If youre interested in working together, I have 1/3 of the paper already done, including CONSORT diagrams, tables, behavioral analysis, etc.   All EEG data are even fully cleaned and pre-processed.   For CTL and sub-acute mTBI: Session 1 was from 3 to 14 days post-injury and was the only session with MRI. (MRI will be uploaded ...later).  Session 2 was ~2 months (1.5 to 3) and Session 3 was ~4 months (3 to 5) following Session 1.   There was A LOT of subject attrition over timepoints.   Same samples as reported here: https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-66677-001   https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31344589/   https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31368085/  10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2019.107125   Same task as this one here:  10.3758/s13415-018-0584-6.   Task included in Matlab programming language.   Data collected 2016-2018 in the Center for Brain Recovery and Repair at the UNM Health Sciences Center.  Check the .xls sheet under code folder for *LOTS* more meta data.   Analysis scripts are included.  - James F Cavanagh 02/17/2021",
