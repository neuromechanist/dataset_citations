  "readme_content": "### Delayed Free Recall of Word Lists\n\n#### Description\nThis dataset contains behavioral events and intracranial electrophysiological recordings from a delayed free recall task.  The experiment consists of participants studying a list of words, presented visually one at a time, completing simple arithmetic problems that function as a distractor, and then freely recalling the words from the just-presented list in any order.  The data was collected at clinical sites across the country as part of a collaboration with the Computational Memory Lab at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n#### To Note\n* The iEEG recordings are labeled either \"monopolar\" or \"bipolar.\"  The monopolar recordings are referenced (typically a mastoid reference), but should always be re-referenced before analysis.  The bipolar recordings are referenced according to a paired scheme indicated by the accompanying bipolar channels tables.\n* Each subject has a unique montage of electrode locations.  MNI and Talairach coordinates are provided when available, along with brain region annotations.\n* Recordings were made on multiple different systems, so we have done the scaling to provide all voltage values in V.\n\n#### Contact\nFor questions or inquiries, please contact sas-kahana-sysadmin@sas.upenn.edu.\n",
