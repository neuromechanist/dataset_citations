Please cite the above paper if you use this data.\n\nThe dataset includes:\n\nMEG data for 9 runs for each subjects. Events files that contain the onsets, durations and trial types for each trial in the experiment (excluding catch trials).\n\nFor a full description of the paradigm and the employed procedures please see the manuscript.  \n\nResults for the first-level analyses for this data can be found on OSF (https://osf.io/vsc6y/). Code for the analysis of the data can be found on Github (https://github.com/Singerjohannes/object_drawing_dynamics/). \n\n\n",
