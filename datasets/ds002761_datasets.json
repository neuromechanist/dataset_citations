  "readme_content": "The MEG files contain a channel with triggers necessary for event marking and timing. Separate event files with onsets are provided in the participant directories for completeness only; the MEG triggers should be used for actual onsets in analysis. The delay between the trigger and the visual onset of an on-screen event sent by the projector is approximately 20 ms, as estimated using a photodiode.\n\nMemory phase triggers: At the onset of a trial, the first trigger represents the category (1-8) of the on-screen image. Categories 1-6 represent actual stimulus categories. Trigger values of 7 and 8 represent the 4 positive and 4 negative story-ending stimuli, respectively. The onset of the answer, approximately 5.5 sec later, is marked by a trigger value of 11.\n\nLocalizer phase triggers: As in the memory phase, at the onset of a trial, the first trigger represents the category (1-8) of the on-screen image. Categories 1-6 represent true categories. Trigger values of 7 and 8 represent the 4 positive and 4 negative story-ending stimuli, respectively. For a baseline, note that for the 2 s prior to picture onset, a word naming that picture was presented on the screen; thus, baseline values should be taken from data more than 2 s before the trigger onset.\n\nMethods note:  a sequenceness analysis step was omitted from the published 2020 Nature Neuroscience paper. The text should have read:  \n\"We next asked whether the βi(Δt) was consistent with a specified 6 × 6 transition matrix by taking the Frobenius inner product between these two matrices (the sum of element-wise products of the two matrices). This resulted in a single number ZΔt, which pertained to lag Δt. For each trial, sequenceness results were then z-scored across lags. Finally, differential forward – backward sequenceness was defined as ZfΔt − ZbΔt.\"",
