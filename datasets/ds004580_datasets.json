Subjects completed  this Simon task (along with multiple other cognitive tasks) \nwhile EEG was recorded with a 64-channel BrainVision cap. This task included a stimulus presented\nto the left or right side of the screen. The researchers instructed participants to press a left key when the \nwas yellow or red and a right key when it was cyan or blue. The stimulus was either spatially congruent \nwith the screen side matching the response hand or incongruent with the screen side contralateral \nto the response hand. The researchers analyzed data from congruent and incongruent trials separately.",
