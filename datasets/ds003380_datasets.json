  "readme_content": "This sedation, ischemia, recovery experiment contains 11 animals (juvenile pigs).\n\nAnimals were surgically instrumented, and then monitored under sedation states 1-5 (isoflurane, fentanyl, propofol), followed by 1 or 2 episodes of gradual ischemia (states 6 and 8) and recovery (recovery 1 = state 7, between state 6 and 8; recovery 2, after state 8, corresponding to states 9-12).\n\nTwo crude groups are indicated: \n1) sedation - animals had no ischemia and \n2) ischemia - animals had sedation, followed by ischemia episodes and followed by recovery.\n\nThe scientific article (see Reference) contains all methodological details.\n- Martin Frasch and Reinhard Bauer, October 2, 2020\n\nPS. Sub-12 folder is to be ignored. It was added to satisfy the BIDS validation algorithm.\n",
