  "readme_content": "Our dataset contains high-density, dual-layer electroencephalography (EEG), neck electromyography (EMG), inertial measurement unit (IMU) acceleration, ground reaction forces, head model constructed from T1 structural MR images from 32 participants walking over uneven terrain and at different speeds. Participants completed two trials for each condition for three minutes and a seated rest trial for three minutes. Digitized electrode locations (txt) are included in each subject folder.\n\nPlease refer to our publication for more detail. \n\nThis study was supported by the National Institute of Health (U01AG061389).",
