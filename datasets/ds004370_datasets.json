D. van Blooijs, S. Blok, G.J.M. Huiskamp, P. van Eijsden, H.G.E. Meijer, F.S.S. Leijten\n\nThe study was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee from the UMC Utrecht, the Netherlands.\n\n## Contact \n- Dorien van Blooijs: D.vanBlooijs@umcutrecht.nl\n- Frans Leijten: F.S.S.leijten@umcutrecht.nl\n\n\n# Data organization\nThis data is organized according to the Brain Imaging Data Structure specification. A community-driven specification for organizing neurophysiology data along with its metadata. For more information on this data specification, see https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ \n\nEach patient has their own folder (e.g., `sub-PRIOS01` to `sub-PRIOS09`) which contains the iEEG recordings data for that patient, as well as the metadata needed to understand the raw data and event timing.\n\nData are logically grouped in the same BIDS session and stored across runs indicating the day and time point of recording during the monitoring period.\nWe use the optional run key-value pair to specify the day and the start time of the recording (e.g. run-021315, day 2 after implantation, which is day 1 of the monitoring period, at 13:15).\nThe task key-value pair in long-term iEEG recordings describes the patient's state during the recording of this file. The task label is “SPESclin“ when these files contain data collected during clinical single pulse electrical stimulation (SPES) and \"SPESprop\" when these files contain data collected during single pulse electrical stimulation (SPES) in the operating room. \n\nElectrode positions were estimated by running Freesurfer on the individual subject MRI scan. All shared electrode positions were converted to MNI305 space using the Freesurfer surface based non-linear transformation. We note that this surface based transformation distorts the dimensions of the grids, but maintains the gyral anatomy.\n\n# License\nThis dataset is made available under the Public Domain Dedication and License CC v1.0, whose full text can be found at \nhttps://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/. \nWe hope that all users will follow the ODC Attribution/Share-Alike Community Norms (http://www.opendatacommons.org/norms/odc-by-sa/); \nin particular, while not legally required, we hope that all users of the data will acknowledge by citing the following in any publication.\nThe effect of propofol on local effective brain networks (submitted).
