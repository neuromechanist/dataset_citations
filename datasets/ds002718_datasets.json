Original data described at https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata20151\nThis is repackaged version of the EEG data in EEGLAB format. The data has gone through\nminimal preprocessing including (see wh_extracteeg_BIDS.m):\n- Ignoring fMRI and MEG data (sMRI preserved for EEG source localization)\n- Extracting EEG channels out of the MEG/EEG fif data\n- Adding fiducials\n- Renaming EOG and EKG channels\n- Extracting events from event channel\n- Removing spurious events 5, 6, 7, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18 and 19\n- Removing spurious event 24 for subject 3 run 4\n- Renaming events taking into account button assigned to each subject\n- Correcting event latencies (events have a shift of 34 ms)\n- Resampling data to 250 Hz (this is a step that is done because\n  this dataset is used as tutorial for EEGLAB and need to be lightweight)\n- Merging run 1 to 6\n- Removing event fields urevent and duration \n- Filling up empty fields for events boundary and stim_file.\n- Saving as EEGLAB .set format\n\nRamon Martinez, Dung Truong, Scott Makeig, Arnaud Delorme (UCSD, La Jolla, CA, USA)\n",
