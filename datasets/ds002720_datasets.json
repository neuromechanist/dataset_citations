PROJECT\r\n------------\r\n\r\nTitle: Brain-Computer Music Interface for Monitoring and Inducing Affective States (BCMI-MIdAS)\r\nDates: 2012-2017\r\nFunding organisation: Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)\r\nGrant no.: EP/J003077/1\r\n\r\n2. DATASET\r\n------------\r\n\r\nTitle: EEG from a Brain-Computer Music Interface for controlling music tempo.\r\n\r\nDescription: This dataset accompanies the publication by Daly et al. (2018) and has been analysed in Daly et al. (2014a; 2014b) (please see Section 5 for full references). The dataset is obtained from a music-based Brain-Computer Interface constructed to allow users to modulate the tempo of a piece of music dynamically via intentional control. The dataset contains the electroencephalogram (EEG) data from 19 healthy participants instructed to increase the tempo of the music via kinaesthetically imagining squeezing a ball in their right hand or decrease the tempo by relaxing. The paradigm was split into 9 runs. The first was a calibration run, containing 30 trials in pairs of increase and decrease tempo trials. \r\n\r\nPublication Year: 2018\r\n\r\nCreators: Nicoletta Nicolaou, Ian Daly\r\n\r\nContributors: Isil Poyraz Bilgin, James Weaver, Asad Malik, Alexis Kirke, Duncan Williams.\r\n\r\nPrincipal Investigator: Slawomir Nasuto (EP/J003077/1).\r\n\r\nCo-Investigator: Eduardo Miranda (EP/J002135/1).\r\n\r\nOrganisation: University of Reading\r\n\r\nRights-holders: University of Reading\r\n\r\nSource: The synthetic generator used to generate the music clips was presented in Williams et al., â€œAffective Calibration of Musical Feature Sets in an Emotionally Intelligent Music Composition Systemâ€, ACM Trans.
