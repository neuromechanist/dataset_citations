They were given a keyboard for button pressing and wore a lightweight headset to record their verbal responses. They were instructed to watch the LCD video monitor that was at a viewing distance of 60in.                                                                                                                         \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nParticipants were presented with 180 sentences in white font on a black background. Conditions consisted of 30 subject-verb agreement violations, 30 semantic violations, 30 double (subject-verb agreement + semantic) violations, 30 word-order violations, and 60 control (correct) sentences. Sentences were presented in an RSVP design, one word at a time, in the middle of the screen for a duration of 600ms with an ISI of 200ms.\u0000",
