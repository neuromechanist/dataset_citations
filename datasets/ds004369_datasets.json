  "readme_content": "Within this study the EOG channels from two previous studies were pooled. \n20 participants from Jaeger et al. (2020) and 21 from Holtze et al. (2021) were included. \nParticipants performed a two-competing speaker paradigm in both original studies. \nParticipants were instructed to either attend to the left or right audio book. \nThe paradigm consisted of six (Jaeger et al. 2020) or five (Holtze et al. 2021) \n10-minute blocks of audio book presentation. In Jaeger et al. (2020) both audio \nbooks were always presented equally loud. In Holtze et al. 2021, a 10-minute block could \n either be presented in the omnidirectional condition (both audio books were presented \nequally loud) or in the beamforming condition (the to-be-attended audio book \nwas louder than the to-be-ignored audio book). The first 10-minute block was always \npresented in the omnidirectional condition whereas the conditions were alternated \nfor the later four blocks, with one half of the participants starting with the \nomnidirectonal condition and the other half starting with the beamforming condition \nThe article (see Reference) contains all methodological details\n\n- Bj√∂rn Holtze (December, 2022)",
