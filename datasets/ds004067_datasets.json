  "readme_content": "Experiment Details\n\nHuman electroencephalography recordings from 80 participants. Participants first provided their attitudes about a set of sociopolitical issues, then view photographs of protests that were ostensibly about those same issues. Prior to each photo, they saw a pie chart indicating social support for the issue (low, medium, or high). After each photo, they indicated their support for the protestors.\n\nOther data and analysis scripts can be found on OSF (DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/32DAS) or at the github repository for the project (https://github.com/Social-Cognitive-Neuroscience-Lab/EEGMoralization)",
