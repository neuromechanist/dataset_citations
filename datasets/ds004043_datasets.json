  "readme_content": "Experiment Details\n\nHuman electroencephalography recordings from 20 participants. Participants viewed rapid sequences of overlaid oriented grating pairs while detecting a “target” grating of a particular orientation. We manipulated attention, one grating was attended and the other ignored (cued by colour), and temporal expectation, with stimulus onset timing either predictable or not.\n\nExperiment length: 1 hour\n\nMore information: \n\nhttps://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/5B8K6 (OSF repository with more information and example analysis code)\n\nMoerel, D., Grootswagers, T., Robinson, A.
