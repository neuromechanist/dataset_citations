  "readme_content": "Within this experiment 25 participants performed a two-competing speaker paradigm. Participants were instructed to either attend to the left or right audio book. The paradigm consisted of five 10-minute blocks of audio book presentation. In each 10-minute block the participants own name was presented 10 times, embedded within the to-be-ignored audio book. A 10-minute block could either be presented in the omnidirectional condition (both audio books were presented equally loud) or within the beamforming condition (the to-be-attended audio book was louder than the to-be-ignored audio book). The first 10-minute block was always presented in the omnidirectional condition whereas the conditions were alternated for the later four blocks, with one half of the participants starting with the omnidirectonal condition and the other half starting with the beamforming condition. The article (https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2021.643705) contains all methodological details\n\n- Bj√∂rn Holtze (January, 2021)",
