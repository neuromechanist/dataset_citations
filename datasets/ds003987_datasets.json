  "readme_content": "Two different tasks.   From: \"Electrophysiological biomarkers of behavioral dimensions from cross-species paradigms\"   Second phase (UH3 phase): Amphetamine trials.    Data for both Bhakta et al. 5CCPT paper (humans only) and Cavanagh et al. PLT paper (humans and mice).      N=23 humans.  3 drug conditions: placebo, 10mg, 20mg.  N=28 mice in code folder.  4 drug condis:  placebo, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0 mg/kg.    EEG Triggers were odd binary recombinations that were re-translated into 0-255 in Matlab.   See .m scripts and Trigger Translator.xls *********** OK!  LISTEN!   The .bdf files were to big to import using this function.  So I imported them in EEGLab, downsampled to 500 Hz, then saved them as .set files.  THEN I ran the import script on these .set files.  So you do not need to re-downsample in STEP1 if you run anything from the code folder.   *********** Data collected circa 2016-2019 in San Diego.  Data analyzed circa 2017-2021 in New Mexico.   - James F Cavanagh 06/16/2021",
