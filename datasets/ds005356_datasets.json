(2025) Hypoactivation of ventromedial frontal cortex in major depressive disorder: an MEG study of the Reward Positivity.   Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging\n\nAn MEG study (306-sensor Elekta Neuromag System) of the Reward Positivity during reinforcement learning.  Participants were all SCID interviewed to meet either control (CTL, non-depressed, n=38) or major depressive disorder (MDD, n=52) group criteria.   Task was an MEG-compatible probabilistic selection task.  We'll upload their T1s and resting state soon.   <jcavanagh@unm.edu>",
