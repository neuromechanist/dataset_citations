  "readme_content": " Introduction\n\nThis EEG dataset contains the electrophysiological signal from sixty-two obese and non-obese preteens \nduring a delayed-verification math task. The stimuli were designed and administered using E-Prime \nsoftware (Version 2) at Arkansas Children Nutrition Center (ACNC), Little Rock, Arkansas.\nThe University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) approved the study protocol. This research\nwas supported by USDA/Agricultural Research Service Project 6026-51000-012-06S.\n\n Raw data files\n\nThe data was acquired with a Geodesic Net Amps 300 system running Netstation 4.5.2 software using \nthe 128-channel Geodesic Hydrocell Sensor Netâ„¢ (Magstim EGI., Eugene OR, USA).\nNo operations have been performed on the data.\n\nParticipant data\n\nThe *Participants.tsv* file contains age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and performance. \n\n\nHow to cite\n\nAll use of this dataset in a publication context requires the following paper\nto be cited:\nAlatorre-Cruz, G.C., Downs, H., Hagood, D., Sorensen, S.T.,  Williams, D.K., Larson-Prior, L. (2022).\nEffect of obesity on arithmetic processing in preteens with high and low math skills. An event-related\npotentials study. Frontiers in Human Neurosciences, In press.\n\n\nContact\nQuestions regarding the EEG data may be addressed to\nCatalina Alatorre-Cruz (gcalatorrecruz@uams.edu).\n\nQuestion regarding the project, in general, may be addressed to\nLinda Larson-Prior (ljlarsonprior@uams.edu).
