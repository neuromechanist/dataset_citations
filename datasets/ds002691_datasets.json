  "readme_content": "This experiment has 20 subjects. Subjects asked to mentally concentrate on\na target (see published article for more information) for periods of about \n15 seconds.\n \nThere are 4 verbal instructions given to subject by an automated computer\nprogram connected to a speakerphone:\n- The instruction is to wait until the experiment starts\n- The instruction is to relax\n- The instruction is to get ready as the trial is about to start\n- The instruction is to mentally concentrate on the target\n \nAll the experiment is performed eye's closed. Relax periods last for about\n9 seconds, are then followed by a period of 6 seconds where the participants\nis asked to \"get ready\" for the trial, followed by a period of 15 seconds of\nconcentration. This sequence is repeated 20 times for each participant.",
