  "readme_content": "Introduction\n\nThis EEG dataset contains the electrophysiological signal from fifty-seven obese and non-obese preteens \nduring a stop-signal task. The stimuli were designed and administered using E-Prime \nsoftware (Version 2) at Arkansas Children Nutrition Center (ACNC), Little Rock, Arkansas.\nThe University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) approved the study protocol. This research\nwas supported by USDA/Agricultural Research Service Project 6026-51000-012-06S.\n\nRaw data files\n\nThe data were acquired with a Geodesic Net Amps 300 system running Netstation 4.5.2 software using \nthe 128-channel Geodesic Hydrocell Sensor Netâ„¢ (Magstim EGI., Eugene OR, USA).\nNo operations have been performed on the data.\n\nParticipant data\n\nThe *Participants.tsv* file contains age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and weight status (WS)\n\nHow to cite\n\nAll use of this dataset in a publication context requires the following paper to be cited: Alatorre-Cruz GC, Downs H, Hagood D, Sorensen ST, Williams DK, Larson-Prior L. Effect of obesity on inhibitory control in preadolescents during stop-signal task. An event-related potentials study. Int J Psychophysiol. 2021 Jul;165:56-67. doi: 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2021.04.003\n\nContact\nQuestions regarding the EEG data may be addressed to\nCatalina Alatorre-Cruz (gcalatorrecruz@uams.edu).\n\nQuestion regarding the project, in general, may be addressed to\nLinda Larson-Prior (ljlarsonprior@uams.edu). \n",
