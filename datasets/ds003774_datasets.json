  "readme_content": "The dataset contains Electroencephalography (EEG) responses from 20 Indian participants, on 12 songs of different genres (from Indian Classical to Goth Rock). Each session indicates a song by its number. \n\nFor the experiment,  the participants were indicated to close their eyes indicated by a single beep, and the song was presented to them on speakers. After listening to each song, a double beep was presented, asking them to open their eyes and rate their familiarity and enjoyment to the song.  The responses were taken on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 meant most familiar or most enjoyable, and 5 meant least familiar or least enjoyable. ",
