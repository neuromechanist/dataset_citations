  "readme_content": "Rest and 3 stimulus auditory oddball data with 25 Parkinson patients and 25 matched controls.  Some more subjects are included in the .xls sheet that don't have EEG data in this task.  C'est la vie.  PD came in twice separated by a week, either ON or OFF medication.  CTL only came in once.  Task included in Matlab programming language, with instructions for eyes open & eyes closed  Triggers included for instructed one minute spans for open or closed (OC or CO) before the task.  Data collected circa 2015 in Cognitive Rhythms and Computation Lab at University of New Mexico.  Subjs also had an acceleromter taped to their most tremor affected hand.  X, Y, Z dimensions recorded throughout.  Check the .xls sheet under code folder for more meta data.   Also code to re-create the paper.  - James F Cavanagh 01/18/2021",
