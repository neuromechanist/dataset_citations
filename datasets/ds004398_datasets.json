  "readme_content": "The MEG files contain a channel with triggers necessary for event marking and timing. Separate event files with onsets are provided in the participant directories for completeness only; the MEG triggers should be used for actual onsets in analysis. The delay between the trigger and the visual onset of an on-screen event sent by the projector is approximately 20 ms, as estimated using a photodiode.\n\nLocalizer phase triggers: [Info to be added]\n\nStruct and Rew phase triggers: [Info to be added]\n\nPost triggers:  [Info to be added]",
