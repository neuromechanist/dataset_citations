  "readme_content": "This experiment includes 139 subjects: 94 individuals with Parkinsons disease, \nand 45 controls. Subjects completed  this IntervalTiming task (along with multiple other cognitive tasks) \nwhile EEG was recorded with a 64-channel BrainVision cap. This task presented black instructional \ntext on the center of a white screen that read \"Short interval\" on 3-second interval trials \nand \"Long interval\" on 7-second interval trials. The researchers never communicated the actual \ninterval durations to the patient. The instructions were displayed for 1 second,  and the appearance \nof an image of a solid box in the center of the computer screen indicated the start of the interval. \nThe cue was displayed on the screen for the entire trial, which lasted 6 s for 3-s intervals and \n14 s for 7-s intervals. The researchers instructed participants to press the keyboard spacebar \nwhen they judged the target interval to have elapsed. Participants were directed not to count, and \na distractor vowel appeared at random intervals in the screen center.",
