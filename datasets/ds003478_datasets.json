  "readme_content": "Resting EEG data with 122 college-age participants. These are the same participants as the Openneuro prob selection task. Subjects have the same task IDs, so you could match them up if you like.   Task included in DMDX programming language, with instructions for eyes open & eyes closed  Triggers included for instrucgted one minute spans for open or closed, e.g. : OCCOCO or COOCOC   Data collected circa 2008-2010 in John J.B. Allen lab at U Arizona.  Subjects scored reliably high or low in Beck Depression Inventory.  Some have been clinically interviewed.  See .xls sheet. For some subjects (maybe all?), HEOG and VEOG may be mis-labeled as the other.  Some files have had some channels interpolated already.  There are no raw data to revert to instead...  I have never even looked at the last rest run; no idea how it looks.  First rest run was high quality though.  The first 6 mins happened immedately after EEG hook-up.  The second 6 minutes came after task performance (about 1 hour later)  516 has no rest2.  544 was unused in all anlayses due to unstable BDI between mass assessment and lab assessment (1-4 months)   - James F Cavanagh 01/18/2021",
